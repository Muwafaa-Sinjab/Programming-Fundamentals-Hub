# 02 - Primary Key vs Foreign Key

## Overview

This lesson explains the difference between the Primary Key and Foreign Key. It shows their purpose, rules, and how they connect tables.

## Main Topics

### Primary Key (PK)

A Primary Key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Important rules:

* Values must be unique.
* It cannot contain `NULL`.
* Its value should remain stable.
* Each table has one Primary Key.

### Foreign Key (FK)

A Foreign Key is a column or group of columns that refers to the Primary Key of another table.

It is used to create a relationship between two tables and helps maintain referential integrity.

### Primary Key vs Foreign Key

| Primary Key                   | Foreign Key                                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Uniquely identifies a record. | Connects a table to another table.                  |
| Values cannot be repeated.    | Values can be repeated.                             |
| Does not accept `NULL`.       | May accept `NULL` depending on the database design. |
| One Primary Key per table.    | A table can have more than one Foreign Key.         |

### Example

In the `Departments` table:

* `ID` is the Primary Key.

In the `Employees` table:

* `ID` is the Primary Key.
* `DepartmentID` is the Foreign Key.
* `DepartmentID` connects the `Employees` table with `Departments.ID`.

## Key Takeaways

* A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record.
* A Primary Key cannot contain duplicate or `NULL` values.
* A Foreign Key connects two tables.
* A Foreign Key refers to a Primary Key in another table.
* Primary Keys and Foreign Keys help create relationships between tables.
* Foreign Keys help maintain referential integrity.
