# 04 - Data Integrity

## Overview

This lesson explains Data Integrity and why data should be accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable throughout its life.

## Main Topics

### Data Integrity

Data Integrity means keeping data accurate, consistent, and reliable from creation to deletion.

Its main goal is to make sure that data is complete, accurate, and trustworthy.

### Causes of Data Integrity Problems

Data integrity can be affected by:

* Human errors.
* Hardware or software failures.
* Security breaches.
* Data transfer errors.

### Protecting Data Integrity

Data integrity can be protected by:

* Using suitable policies and procedures.
* Using encryption.
* Making regular backups.
* Controlling access permissions.

### Types of Data Integrity

#### Entity Integrity

Ensures that every record is unique and can be clearly identified.

It uses **Primary Keys**.

#### Referential Integrity

Ensures that relationships between tables remain valid and prevents orphaned records.

It uses **Foreign Keys**.

#### Domain Integrity

Ensures that data uses valid and accepted values.

For example, a date field should contain a valid date, and a salary should be a positive number.

#### Business Integrity

Ensures that data follows the business rules and conditions of an organization.

### Data Integrity Problems

Examples of incorrect data include:

* An employee name containing invalid symbols such as `U@s#5#Z 9E`.
* A negative salary such as `-400`.
* A birth date entered in the name field.
* An employee assigned to department `5` when only departments `1` to `4` exist.

### Constraints

**Constraints** are the main tool used to maintain Data Integrity in relational databases.

## Key Takeaways

* Data Integrity keeps data accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable.
* Human errors, system failures, security breaches, and transfer errors can affect data integrity.
* Entity Integrity uses Primary Keys.
* Referential Integrity uses Foreign Keys.
* Domain Integrity controls valid data values.
* Business Integrity ensures that data follows business rules.
* Constraints help maintain Data Integrity.
