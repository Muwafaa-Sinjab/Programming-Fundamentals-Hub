# 02 - What is NULL?

## Overview

This lesson explains `NULL` in databases. It shows what `NULL` means, how it is different from `0` and blank values, and when it can be used.

## Main Topics

### `NULL`

`NULL` is a special marker used when there is no value in a column.

It can mean that data is **missing** or **unknown**.

### `NULL` vs Zero and Blank

* `NULL` — No value exists.
* `0` — A known numeric value equal to zero.
* `""` / Blank — An empty text value.

`NULL` is not equal to `0` or a blank value.

### Uses of `NULL`

`NULL` can be used for:

* **Missing Data** — The information is not available when the record is added.
* **Optional Fields** — The field is not required, such as an additional phone number.
* **Temporary Value** — The value is not available yet and can be updated later.

### Example

In an `Employees` table, employee `2` (`Ali Zaher`) has `NULL` in the `Birthdate` and `Salary` fields.

This means the birth date and salary are unknown or have not been recorded yet.

### Important Note

`NULL` must be handled carefully in queries and calculations because it can cause unexpected results in comparisons and aggregation.

## Key Takeaways

* `NULL` means that there is no value.
* `NULL` can represent missing or unknown data.
* `NULL` is different from `0` and blank values.
* `NULL` can be used for optional or temporary data.
* `NULL` needs careful handling in queries and calculations.
